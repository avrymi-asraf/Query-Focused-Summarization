This paper formalizes this hypothesis, defining linear representation in terms of counterfactual pairs of inputs and outputs that vary along a specific concept. It establishes that this \"subspace\" notion of linear representation connects to \"measurement\" (predicting a concept using linear probes) in the output space and \"intervention\" (altering a concept by adding vectors) in the input space. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which respects the semantic independence of causally separable concepts by making their representations orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the input and output space representations, allowing for the construction of intervention vectors from input representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, demonstrate their connection to interpretability and control, and highlight the crucial role of the chosen inner product.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The linear representation hypothesis suggests high-level concepts are linear directions in a model's representation space.\n*   Linear representations are formalized using counterfactual pairs, linking to \"measurement\" (prediction) and \"intervention\" (control).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, unifying input and output representations.\n*   This causal inner product is crucial for understanding and manipulating concepts within language models, as demonstrated with LLaMA-2.",

This paper formalizes this hypothesis by defining linear representations in both output (unembedding) and input (embedding) spaces using counterfactual pairs. The unembedding representation is linked to \"measurement\" (predicting a concept's value), while the embedding representation is tied to \"intervention\" (altering a concept's value). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product\" which, when applied, unifies these two notions of linear representation. This inner product ensures that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. Experiments with LLaMA-2 (7 billion parameters, 4096 embedding dimensions) empirically validate the existence of these linear representations for various concepts (e.g., gender, language, verb conjugations) and demonstrate that the causal inner product respects semantic structure, aligning causally separable concepts as orthogonal. The study confirms that these linear directions can be used for both interpreting and controlling model behavior, and provides code for reproducibility.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The linear representation hypothesis suggests concepts are linear directions in a model's representation space, enabling interpretation and control through linear algebra.\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in both embedding (input context) and unembedding (output word) spaces using counterfactual pairs, linking them to intervention and measurement respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations and ensures orthogonality for causally separable concepts.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 (7B parameters) empirically support the hypothesis, showing linear representations for various concepts and validating the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure.\n*   Code for the experiments is publicly available, facilitating further research.",

This paper formalizes this hypothesis by defining \"linear representation\" in two ways: as a subspace in the output (unembedding) space, linked to measurement (probing), and as a subspace in the input (embedding) space, linked to intervention (steering). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which formalizes the idea that causally separable concepts should be orthogonal. This specific inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for a consistent geometric understanding of concepts. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations for various concepts, confirm the connection between subspace representations and model interpretation/control, and highlight the crucial role of the chosen inner product. The paper provides code for replication.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The linear representation hypothesis suggests concepts are linear directions in LLM representation spaces, enabling interpretation and control.\n*   Two formalizations of linear representation are proposed: unembedding (linked to measurement) and embedding (linked to intervention).\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear concept representations and their utility for interpretation and control.\n*   The choice of inner product is critical for understanding and manipulating these linear representations.",

This paper formalizes this idea by defining \"linear representation\" in two ways: as a subspace in the output (unembedding) space, which relates to measurement (probing), and as a subspace in the input (embedding) space, which relates to intervention (steering). The core contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which formalizes the geometric notion of orthogonality for causally separable concepts. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations for various concepts, validate the connection between linear representations and interpretability/control, and highlight the crucial role of the chosen inner product in capturing semantic structure. The work shows that while Euclidean geometry might offer some approximations, a specifically defined causal inner product better reflects the underlying semantic organization of concepts within LLMs.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The \"linear representation hypothesis\" suggests high-level concepts are linear directions in a model's representation space.\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in both \"unembedding\" (output) and \"embedding\" (input) spaces, linking them to measurement (probing) and intervention (steering), respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This causal inner product enables the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations, facilitating model control.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 support the hypothesis, showing linear concept representations and the effectiveness of the causal inner product for interpretability and control.",

This paper formalizes this hypothesis, clarifying what \"linear representation\" means by proposing three interpretations: subspace, measurement, and intervention. It then demonstrates that these notions are interconnected. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" defined by the property that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the different formalizations of linear representations, allowing for a consistent geometric understanding. The paper also addresses the challenge of identifying this inner product, proposing a method based on the covariance of unembedding vectors derived from random word samples. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and ensuring orthogonality between separable concepts, and demonstrate how these representations can be used for both interpreting model behavior (measurement) and controlling it (intervention).\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The linear representation hypothesis posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions in a model's representation space.\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations into \"unembedding\" (related to measurement) and \"embedding\" (related to intervention) notions, showing they are linked.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which makes causally separable concepts orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear concept representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure and allows for model interpretation and control.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe linear representation hypothesis suggests that high-level concepts in language models are encoded as linear directions within their representation spaces. This paper formalizes this hypothesis, clarifying what \"linear representation\" means by proposing three interpretations: subspace, measurement, and intervention. It then demonstrates that these notions are interconnected. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" defined by the property that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the different formalizations of linear representations, allowing for a consistent geometric understanding. The paper also addresses the challenge of identifying this inner product, proposing a method based on the covariance of unembedding vectors derived from random word samples. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure and ensuring orthogonality between separable concepts, and demonstrate how these representations can be used for both interpreting model behavior (measurement) and controlling it (intervention).\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The linear representation hypothesis posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions in a model's representation space.\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations into \"unembedding\" (related to measurement) and \"embedding\" (related to intervention) notions, showing they are linked.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which makes causally separable concepts orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear concept representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure and allows for model interpretation and control.",
