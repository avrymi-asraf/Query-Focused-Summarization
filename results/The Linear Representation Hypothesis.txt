SUMMARY:
This paper formalizes the "Linear Representation Hypothesis," which posits that high-level concepts are represented linearly in large language models (LLMs). 
The authors define two formalizations of linear representation: in the output (unembedding) space, linked to measurement, and in the input (embedding) space, linked to intervention. 
They introduce a "causal inner product" that treats causally separable concepts as orthogonal. 
This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. 
Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations for various concepts, demonstrate that the causal inner product respects semantic structure by making causally separable concepts orthogonal, and show that these representations can be used for both interpretation (measurement) and control (intervention). 
The work clarifies the relationship between different notions of linear representation and highlights the critical role of the inner product choice.

SUMMARY:
This paper formalizes the "linear representation hypothesis," which posits that high-level concepts are represented as linear directions in the representation space of large language models (LLMs). 
The authors define two types of linear representations: unembedding representations (in the output space) and embedding representations (in the input space). 
They demonstrate that unembedding representations are linked to model measurement (probing), while embedding representations are connected to model intervention (steering). 
A central contribution is the introduction of a "causal inner product," defined by the property that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. 
This causal inner product unifies the unembedding and embedding representations. 
The paper proposes an estimation method for this inner product using the covariance of unembedding vectors, leading to an explicit form: `⟨γ, γ'⟩C := γᵀCov(γ)⁻¹γ'`. 
Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations, show that the causal inner product respects semantic structure by making causally separable concepts orthogonal, and confirm that these representations can be used for probing and steering. 
The study also highlights the importance of the inner product choice, showing that while the Euclidean inner product performs surprisingly well on LLaMA-2, the causal inner product is more robust and semantically meaningful, especially for models like Gemma.
