This paper formalizes this hypothesis by defining \"linear representation\" in terms of counterfactual pairs of inputs/outputs. It establishes that \"unembedding representations\" (related to output words) connect to measurement (predicting concepts), while \"embedding representations\" (related to input contexts) connect to intervention (controlling concepts). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which formalizes the idea that causally separable concepts should be orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations, their link to interpretation and control, and the critical role of the chosen inner product in revealing semantic structure. The work clarifies how linear algebraic operations can be leveraged for understanding and manipulating model behavior.\n\n2.

SUMMARY:\nThe \"linear representation hypothesis\" posits that high-level concepts within large language models (LLMs) are represented as linear directions in their representation spaces. This paper formalizes this hypothesis, addressing ambiguities in what \"linear representation\" means. It proposes two formalizations: \"unembedding representations\" in the output space, which connect to measurement tasks (like linear probing), and \"embedding representations\" in the input space, linked to intervention tasks (like model steering). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" defined by orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts. This inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for geometric notions like similarity and projection to be semantically meaningful. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, demonstrate the effectiveness of the causal inner product in capturing semantic structure, and confirm the connections between linear representations and model interpretability/control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The linear representation hypothesis suggests concepts are linear directions in LLM representation spaces, enabling interpretation and control via linear algebra.\n*   Concepts are formally defined using counterfactual pairs of words that vary only in a specific concept (e.g., \"king\" vs. \"queen\" for the male/female concept).\n*   Unembedding representations are linked to measurement (probing), while embedding representations are linked to intervention (steering).\n*   A causal inner product, where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, unifies these different notions of linear representation.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear representations and the utility of the causal inner product for interpretability and control.",

SUMMARY:\nThe linear representation hypothesis posits that high-level concepts within neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), are represented as linear directions in their representation spaces. This paper formalizes this hypothesis by defining linear representations in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces using counterfactual examples. It establishes that unembedding representations are linked to \"measurement\" (e.g., linear probing), while embedding representations are linked to \"intervention\" (e.g., model steering). A key challenge is identifying the appropriate geometric structure, specifically the inner product, for these spaces. The authors introduce a \"causal inner product\" that represents causally separable concepts as orthogonal directions. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations and can be estimated from model data. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear representations for various concepts and demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure and enables controlled manipulation of model behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The linear representation hypothesis suggests concepts are linear directions in LLM representation spaces, enabling interpretation and control through linear algebra.\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in unembedding (output) and embedding (input) spaces using counterfactual pairs, linking them to measurement and intervention, respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, defined by orthogonality of causally separable concepts, which unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 empirically support the existence of linear concept representations and the effectiveness of the proposed causal inner product for understanding and controlling model behavior.",

      "summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThis paper formalizes the \"linear representation hypothesis,\" which posits that high-level concepts in language models are represented as linear directions in their internal representation spaces. The authors provide formal definitions for linear representations in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces, linking them to model control (intervention) and interpretability (measurement) respectively. A key challenge addressed is the choice of an appropriate inner product for these spaces, as standard Euclidean inner products do not inherently capture semantic structure. The paper introduces a \"causal inner product\" that enforces orthogonality between representations of causally separable concepts. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations and allows for the construction of interpretable probes and controllable steering vectors. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear concept representations, validate the properties of the causal inner product, and confirm its utility in connecting representation geometry to model interpretability and control.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The linear representation hypothesis suggests concepts are linear directions in a model's representation space, enabling interpretation and control through linear algebra.\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces, linking them to intervention (control) and measurement (interpretability), respectively.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, which enforces orthogonality between causally separable concepts and unifies embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of linear concept representations and demonstrate that the causal inner product effectively captures semantic structure for interpretability and control tasks.",
