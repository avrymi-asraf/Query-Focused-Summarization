Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as foundational infrastructure in the pursuit of
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite their remarkable capabilities in language perception
and generation, current LLMs fundamentally lack a unified and structured architecture for
handling memory. They primarily rely on parametric memory (knowledge encoded in model
weights) and ephemeral activation memory (context-limited runtime states). While emerging
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporate plaintext memory, they lack
lifecycle management and multi-modal integration, limiting their capacity for long-term knowledge
evolution. To address this, we introduce —a memory operating system designed for LLMs that, for
the first time, elevates memory to a first-class operational resource. It builds unified mechanisms
for representation, organization, and governance across three core memory types: parametric,
activation, and plaintext. At its core is the MemCube, a standardized memory abstraction
that enables tracking, fusion, and migration of heterogeneous memory, while offering structured,
traceable access across tasks and contexts. MemOS establishes a memory-centric execution
framework with strong controllability, adaptability, and evolvability. It fills a critical gap in current
LLM infrastructure and lays the groundwork for continual adaptation, personalized intelligence,
and cross-platform coordination in next-generation intelligent systems.

Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a foundational pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence
(AGI) [39], yet they remain fundamentally limited in supporting robust memory capabilities. Most current
architectures rely on implicit parametric memory—knowledge embedded within massive model weights—which
is difficult to interpret [37], update [20], or transfer [13]. Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

1

incorporates external knowledge sources [3, 8, 10, 11, 38], it effectively serves as an ad hoc textual patch and
lacks a structured, unified mechanism for memory management. These architectural shortcomings lead to four
critical issues in real-world applications: inability to model long-term and multi-turn conversational states;
poor adaptability to evolving knowledge; lack of persistent modeling for user preferences and multi-agent
workflows; and the emergence of “memory silos” across platforms, hindering the reuse and migration of prior
interactions. At the root of these challenges lies a fundamental oversight: current LLMs do not treat memory
as an explicit, schedulable, and governable resource.

To address this, we propose —a memory operating system designed for large language models. MemOS
centers memory units as operational resources and establishes a full lifecycle encompassing memory generation,
organization, utilization, and evolution. It offers structured representations, unified interfaces, version control,
and access governance to overcome systemic limitations in memory handling. Rather than merely extending
the RAG paradigm, MemOS introduces a controllable, adaptable, and evolvable memory infrastructure that
empowers LLMs to track knowledge updates, internalize user preferences, and maintain behavioral consistency
across platforms. This represents a fundamental shift in language model architecture: from systems that
merely perceive and generate to those that remember, adapt, and grow over time.

2 Memory in Large Language Models

Figure 1 Memory (Mem) in LLMs.

Research into LLM memory has progressed through three major stages (see Figure 1).

The first is the Memory Definition and Exploration stage, in which researchers classify and analyze memory
mechanisms along dimensions such as parametric vs. non-parametric and short-term vs. long-term memory
[7, 23, 30]. For implicit memory, pre-training and adapter-based methods embed knowledge directly into model
weights, while knowledge editing techniques enable targeted post hoc modifications [1, 2, 5, 9, 14, 19, 24, 26, 32].
KV-caches and hidden states constitute the core of implicit short-term memory, preserving contextual continuity
and guiding generation behavior during inference [6, 16, 25, 27, 28]. Explicit short-term memory typically
involves prompt concatenation within the context window, but remains limited by context length constraints
[18, 21]. Explicit long-term memory leverages external retrieval mechanisms, increasingly adopting structured
formats—such as graphs and trees—to improve semantic integration and retrieval efficiency [8, 15, 31, 35].

The second stage involves the Emergence of Human-like Memory, where systems optimized for long-term per-
sistence, context awareness, and self-reflection begin to exhibit structural and behavioral patterns reminiscent
of human memory. Examples include brain-inspired architectures such as HippoRAG and Memory3 [12, 34],
as well as systems like PGRAG and Second-Me [17, 29], which support behavior continuity and personalized
memory modeling.

The third stage advances toward Systematic Memory Management, integrating tool-based operations with
OS-inspired governance frameworks. This includes toolkits such as EasyEdit and Mem0, which support

management and modular invocation. However, these systems still fall short of providing unified scheduling,
lifecycle governance, and memory fusion across roles or agents.

3 MemOS Design Philosophy

As AGI continues to evolve into increasingly complex systems characterized by multi-tasking, multi-role collab-
oration, and multi-modality, language models must move beyond merely “understanding the world”—they must
also “accumulate experience,” “retain memory,” and “continuously evolve.” However, prevailing architectures
remain anchored in static parameters and lack structured modeling and unified management of memory,
rendering them inadequate for supporting knowledge updates, state retention, and personalized adaptation.
We propose that treating memory as a first-class resource and building a memory-centric execution paradigm
is key to enabling continual adaptation and long-term reasoning in future LLMs.

As shown in Figure 2, traditional scaling laws are approaching diminishing returns. The research paradigm
is shifting from data- and parameter-centric pretraining to post-training paradigms focused on alignment
and fine-tuning. Yet even this refined approach faces dual challenges: diminishing performance gains and
increasing engineering complexity. We posit that the next fundamental leap will arise from the ability to
continuously model and schedule memory—enabling LLMs to maintain contextual consistency, adapt to
evolving knowledge, and support iterative refinement across tasks.

To this end, we introduce MemOS—a prototype
system designed to support a new memory-centric
training paradigm, where learning and inference are
no longer separate phases but part of a unified,
memory-driven process. MemOS not only enables
structured memory storage, interface-level invoca-
tion, and lifecycle management, but also provides
unified scheduling and version control mechanisms
that constitute the foundational infrastructure for
sustainable intelligence evolution. In our design vi-
sion, MemOS treats memory as a schedulable core
resource, breaking down silos between agents, users,
applications, and sessions. It adopts evolution as
a central management objective—supporting mem-
ory recomposition, migration, and fusion to facil-
itate long-term capability growth. Simultaneously,
governance is a foundational pillar: MemOS inte-
grates access control, traceability, and interpretabil-
ity mechanisms to ensure safe and compliant model
operation in complex environments.

Figure 2 The next leap in model capability evolution
hinges on the introduction of memory systems, marking a
paradigm shift toward “memory training”.

4.1 Types of Memory in MemOS
In MemOS, memory is not merely a container of knowledge, but serves as the continuous substrate for
perception, understanding, and action within the model. To systematically support LLMs in evolving across
diverse tasks and scenarios, MemOS classifies memory into three core types: Parametric Memory, Activation
Memory, and Plaintext Memory. Each type differs in its representation, lifecycle, and invocation mechanism,
collectively forming the multi-layered structure of an intelligent agent’s cognitive system.

Parametric Memory refers to long-term knowledge encoded directly into model weights through pretraining
or fine-tuning, embedded within feedforward and attention layers. It can participate in inference without
the need for external retrieval. This memory type underpins fundamental language understanding, general
knowledge, and skill modules—serving as the backbone for zero-shot generation and capability-driven agents.

modular, domain-specific injection—such as legal or medical knowledge—via pluggable LoRA-based modules
for efficient composition and reuse.

Activation Memory denotes the transient cognitive state generated during inference, including hidden layer
activations, attention weights, and KV-cache structures. It plays a critical role in context awareness, instruction
alignment, and behavior modulation. MemOS treats activation memory as a “working memory” layer,
enabling dynamic scheduling for tasks such as context persistence, stylistic control, and behavioral supervision.
Frequently accessed activation states—such as KV-caches or attention patterns—can be transformed into
semi-structured fragments or parametric modules, allowing short-term memory to persist and evolve over
time.

Plaintext Memory comprises explicit knowledge retrieved from external sources, characterized by properties
such as editability, shareability, and governance compatibility. Typical formats include documents, knowledge
graphs, and prompt templates. This memory type addresses the limitations of context window size and
fixed parameters, enabling rapid knowledge updates, personalized injection, and multi-agent collaboration.
In MemOS, plaintext memory contributes to inference context generation and supports versioning, access
control, and invocation tracing—serving as the foundation of knowledge governance.

These three types of memory are unified under a standard operational abstraction in MemOS: the Memory Cube
(MemCube), which supports cross-type scheduling, lifecycle management, and structured fusion. By enabling
transformation pathways between memory types (e.g., Activation → Plaintext, Plaintext → Parametric),
MemOS establishes a scalable memory runtime that elevates LLMs from mere language generators to
memory-enabled, adaptive, and continually evolving agents.

Figure 3 Transformation paths among three types of memory, forming a unified, controllable, and evolvable memory
space.

4.2 Memory Cube (MemCube) as a Core Resource

In MemOS, the key to unifying and evolving heterogeneous memory resources lies in standardizing their
representation and management mechanisms. To this end, we introduce MemCube as the system’s fundamental
encapsulation unit (see Figure 4). The memory resources of LLMs span parametric knowledge, KV-caches,
and externally injected content—each differing in origin, lifecycle, and invocation semantics. MemCube unifies
these heterogeneous forms through a consistent data structure and interface, encapsulating both a semantic
payload and structured metadata to enable uniform scheduling, access control, and lifecycle governance.
MemCube metadata is organized into three categories to support memory identification, control, and evolution:

Descriptive Metadata Used to identify the memory unit and define its semantic role. This includes
timestamps (for creation or updates), origin signatures (e.g., user input, inference output), and semantic types
(e.g., user preference, task prompt, domain knowledge).

payload—serving as the smallest execution unit of memory in MemOS.

Governance Attributes Enable safe and controlled usage in multi-user environments. These include access
permissions, lifespan policies (e.g., time-to-live or frequency-based decay), priority levels, and compliance
mechanisms such as sensitivity tags, watermarking, and access logging.

Behavioral Indicators Capture runtime usage patterns—automatically collected metrics such as access fre-
quency, context relevance, and version lineage—that inform dynamic scheduling and cross-type transformation.
This mechanism supports automatic adaptations, such as:

• Plaintext ⇒ Activation: Frequently accessed plaintext memory is converted into activation templates to

reduce re-decoding costs;

• Plaintext/Activation ⇒ Parametric: Stable, reusable knowledge is distilled into parametric structures to

boost inference efficiency;

• Parametric ⇒ Plaintext: Rarely used or outdated parameters are externalized into editable plaintext for

greater flexibility.

With contextual fingerprinting and policy-aware scheduling, the system enables on-demand activation,
hierarchical caching, and structural evolution—making MemCube a self-aware and continuously adaptive
memory unit.

4.3 MemOS Architecture
To support unified and adaptive memory handling in LLMs, provides an execution framework for memory
parsing, scheduling, and governance. As shown in Figure 5, it manages the full memory lifecycle via the
MemoryCube abstraction. MemOS adopts a modular three-layer architecture, forming a closed-loop memory
governance framework across the Interface Layer, Operation Layer, and Infrastructure Layer (see Figure 6).

The Interface Layer serves as the system entry point, responsible for parsing natural language requests,
identifying memory-related intents, and invoking standardized Memory APIs. The built-in MemReader
component translates user inputs into structured memory operation chains. The Operation Layer functions
as the central controller, orchestrating components such as MemScheduler, MemLifecycle, and MemOperator
to support task-aware scheduling, lifecycle control, and structural organization across users and workflows.
The Infrastructure Layer provides the foundational support for reliable execution, offering memory storage,
access control, and cross-platform interoperability through modules such as MemVault, MemGovernance, and
MemStore.

parsing, scheduling, activation, governance, and evolution—unified via MemCube.

Interface Layer: Memory API and Pipeline The Interface Layer is centered around a unified Memory
API, offering key interfaces including Provenance API, Update API, and LogQuery API—used respectively
for annotating memory sources, updating memory contents, and querying usage traces. All operations are
encapsulated within the MemoryCube structure and governed by access control mechanisms provided through
MemGovernance. To support multi-stage and composable workflows, MemOS introduces a pipeline-style
operation chain mechanism. Each pipeline node transmits context, state, and intermediate outputs via
MemoryCube, enabling transaction control, customizable topologies, and DAG-based scheduling. Developers
can construct common operation patterns (e.g., Query–Update–Archive) to enable reuse across multi-model
collaboration scenarios and ensure consistent memory operations.

Operation Layer: Memory Scheduling and Lifecycle Management The Operation Layer orchestrates
memory scheduling, lifecycle evolution, and organization. MemScheduler dynamically selects parametric,
activation, or plaintext memory based on user-, task-, or organization-level context, supporting pluggable
strategies such as least-recently-used (LRU), semantic similarity, and label-based matching. MemLifecycle
models the memory lifecycle as a state machine and supports version rollback and freezing mechanisms
to ensure auditability and temporal consistency. MemOperator manages memory through tagging systems,
graph-based structures, and multi-layer partitions, enabling hybrid structural and semantic search. Retrieved
results are linked back to MemScheduler to determine activation paths. Frequently accessed memory entries
are cached at an intermediate layer to optimize performance. Collectively, these components enable effective
structuring, precise invocation, and robust reasoning across tasks and agents.

Infrastructure Layer: Governance and Memory Store The Infrastructure Layer governs memory compli-
ance, storage, and circulation, ensuring system trustworthiness and long-term evolvability. MemGovernance
enforces access permissions, lifecycle policies, and audit trails to ensure secure and accountable memory opera-
tions in multi-user environments. MemVault manages diverse memory repositories and provides unified access
across heterogeneous storage backends. MemLoader and MemDumper facilitate structured memory migration

MemStore supports the open publishing
and subscription of memory units, enabling multi-model knowledge sharing and collaborative execution.

Overall, the system operates through a closed-loop Memory I/O Path, with all modules interfacing via
the MemoryCube abstraction. It supports view customization, access isolation, and extensibility to future
multi-modal scenarios.

4.4 System Execution Flow

As illustrated in Figure 6, a MemOS execution begins with a user prompt or triggered task, parsed by
MemReader into a structured Memory API call. This call initiates a pipeline, where context and state are passed
via MemoryCube units. MemScheduler then selects relevant memory (parametric, activation, or plaintext) based
on access patterns and scheduling policies. Retrieved units are injected into the reasoning context. MemOperator
organizes memory semantically and structurally, while MemLifecycle governs state transitions. Archived
memory is persisted in MemVault, managed by MemGovernance, and can be uploaded to or downloaded from
MemStore for inter-agent collaboration. Migration between agents is supported by MemLoader/MemDumper.
This process forms a closed-loop memory flow—from input to activation, transformation, storage, and
reuse—driven by declarative policies and executed through the MemoryCube abstraction.

injection to response generation, each phase is executed via standardized MemoryCube structures that enable traceable
and structured memory lifecycle management.

5 Conclusion

In this work, we introduce a memory operating system designed for Large Language Models, aimed at
collaboratively building foundational memory infrastructure for next-generation LLM applications.

MemOS provides a unified abstraction and integrated management framework for heterogeneous memory types,
including parametric memory, activation memory, and explicit plaintext memory. We propose a standardized
memory unit, MemCube, and implement key modules for scheduling, lifecycle management, structured storage,
and transparent augmentation. These components collectively enhance reasoning coherence, adaptability, and
system scalability in LLMs. Building on this foundation, we envision a future intelligent ecosystem centered
on modular memory resources and supported by a decentralized memory marketplace. This paradigm shift
enables the creation of next-generation AI systems capable of continual learning and long-term evolution.

Looking ahead, we plan to explore the following directions:

• Cross-LLM Memory Sharing: Enable interoperability and module reuse across different foundation
models by sharing parametric and activation memories. To support consistent semantics and secure
exchange, we plan to extend the Memory Interchange Protocol (MIP) to define standard formats,

Overall, with the introduction of MemOS, we aim to transition LLMs from closed, static generation systems
to continuously evolving intelligent agents equipped with long-term memory, integrated knowledge, and
behavioral plasticity. MemOS not only addresses critical architectural limitations in current models but also
lays the groundwork for cross-task, cross-platform, and multi-agent collaborative intelligence. We look forward
to advancing the frontiers of MemOS in collaboration with the community, making memory a first-class
computational resource in the age of general-purpose AI.
